The yml file in this directory creates the following Glance widget.

If you're not a fan of the flag aesthetic, you can delete the img tag in the yml that calls to flagcdn.com. The API also shows the number of wins for the constructor if you want to display that as well. 

If you want to adjust the number of teams displayed by default before going to "show more", then you can edit the ul tag where it references "data-collapse-after."
