The yml file in this directory creates the following Glance widget.

Please make sure to add an environment variable called "F1_API_URL" that would contain your local IP. If Glance and glance-F1 are on the same computer, then you can specify local host, otherwise the local IP. If you prefer not to use environment variables, you need to edit each of the widget yamls and remove ${F1_API_URL} with your IP.

Additional fields you can add from the API might be "first participation year", constructor that has the fastest lap, etc.
